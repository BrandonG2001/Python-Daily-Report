# Daily Report Using Python

You should really only need to edit the personal information template

# EXE

Use the create_exe function. It will also copy the personal_information template to the personal_information.py file if it doesn't exist.

# Run through IDE (VS code, ect)

Make sure to copy the personal_information template to personal_information.py. The report function itself is the daily_report.py file but the GUI for it is the gui_frontend_ui_v2.py
